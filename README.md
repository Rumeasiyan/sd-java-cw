# Software Development II Coursework README

This README provides an overview of the "Theatre" Java program that I have developed for the 4COSC010C Software Development II coursework for the academic year 2022-2023. The program is designed to manage and control the seats in a theater, allowing users to buy, cancel, view seating information, save and load data, and more.

## Program Overview

The program is structured into two parts, Part A and Part B, each containing multiple tasks. It follows the requirements outlined in the coursework description.

### Part A: Main Program

Part A focuses on creating the main program that includes a menu and various functionalities to manage theater seats. Here is a brief overview of the tasks completed in Part A:

- Task 1: The main program, called "Theatre.java," displays a welcome message and initializes arrays to track seat availability.
- Task 2: Implemented a menu with 8 options for users to choose from.
- Task 3: Created the "buy_ticket" method to allow users to purchase tickets.
- Task 4: Developed the "print_seating_area" method to display the seating status.
- Task 5: Implemented the "cancel_ticket" method to make seats available again.
- Task 6: Created the "show_available" method to display available seats.
- Task 7: Developed the "save" method to save data to a file.
- Task 8: Implemented the "load" method to load data from a file.

### Part B: Classes and Objects

Part B involves creating and using classes and objects to manage customers and ticket information. Here is a brief overview of the tasks completed in Part B:

- Task 9: Created a "Person" class with attributes and a constructor.
- Task 10: Developed a "Ticket" class with attributes and a constructor, including a "Person" object.
- Task 11: Added a "print" method to the "Ticket" class.
- Task 12: Created an ArrayList to manage tickets and updated the buy and cancel ticket methods accordingly.
- Task 13: Implemented the "show_tickets_info" method to display ticket information and total price.
- Task 14: Developed the "sort_tickets" method to sort tickets by price in ascending order.

## How to Run the Program

1. Download and extract the provided "code.zip" file.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA or Netbeans).
3. Run the "Theatre.java" file to start the program.
